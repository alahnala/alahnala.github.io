We had a fantastic time at CAISA lab organizing the 1st **Women4women IT Summer School** with Hessian AI at University of Marburg, with girls from all over Germany! All materials are freely available in both English and German on our [GitHub here](github.com/caisa-lab/it-summer-school)! More details on the CAISA website [here](https://caisa-lab.github.io/2022/10/07/summer-school.html) and [here](https://caisa.informatik.uni-marburg.de/summerschool.html).
