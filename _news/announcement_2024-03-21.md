We presented our work "Archetypes and Entropy: Theory-Driven Extraction of Evidence for Suicide Risk" CLPsych on March 21, representing an interdisciplinary and international group of researchers! Our method integrates psychological theory on suicide risk factors in both the suicide risk evidence identification and explanation parts of a system with archetypes of suicidality. You can find our paper here: [https://aclanthology.org/2024.clpsych-1.28/](https://aclanthology.org/2024.clpsych-1.28/) and our code here: [https://github.com/humanlab/clp24-arch-entropy](https://github.com/humanlab/clp24-arch-entropy)
